# Welcome to the Snippets "Wiki"

The aim of this repo/site is to provide helpful code snippets, commands, and tips I've found as I've used macOS and Linux systems. The eventual hope is to make these avalible to others to use and editable (through a PR) so corrections and additions are possible.

The site powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Learn theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-learn/).
